I'm relentless (but you can call me yuri), and welcome to my GitHub! Here's where my website code lives, as well as the other millions (at least, that's what it feels like) of repos.

I'm currently a high school student, hoping to be a computer science major or an English teacher (in Tokyo, Japan)

I mainly use Python and the web languages ((S)CSS, HTML, JS).

See ya in the _Repositories_ tab!

With much love,
yuri
